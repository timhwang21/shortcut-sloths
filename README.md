**Shortcut Sloths** is a game about text editor shortcuts. The purpose of this game is to introduce features of modern text editors in order to **increase typing speed** and **improve programmer happiness**. It is inspired by similar games like [Flexbox Froggies](http://flexboxfroggy.com) and [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/).

It is recommended to play this game with your favorite text editor open, and trying out every new shortcut in your editor as you play!

**Currently, Shortcut Sloths is configured to only work for Mac hotkeys. Sorry!**
